## Directions

Given a 2-dimensional array that summarizes the results of the battle between 2 groups of troops. In each troop,
there are small troops led by their respective Generals.

If the General's number is positive, then in a battle, the General's troops won by that number
If the General's number is negative, then in a battle, the General's troops lost by that number

Your job is to output battle statistics such as the example

Example:
let battle = [
["Hwang Shi Mok", -1],
["Savants", 1],
["Hwang Shi Mok", 2],
["Hwang Shi Mok", 1],
["Savants", 5],
["Legolas", 10],
["Legolas", -20],
["Legolas", -10],
]
console.log(battleStats(battle))
Output:
{
"Hwang Shi Mok": {
"Lost": 1,
"Won": 3
},
"Savants": {
"Lost": 0,
"Won": 6 
},
 "Legolas": {
 "Lose": 30,
 "Wins": 10
 },
} */
